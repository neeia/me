      The NEIA-model (/ˌneɪ.ə/) developer is a neural network model that started
      out really stupid and trained over decades to be less stupid. This model
      includes highly developed natural language processing skills, being able
      to converse with her peers, passing the Turing test. In 2018, she was sent
      to Northeastern University to further train on advanced data as part of a
      collaboration. At the end of 2021, her official training had come to an
      end, and she was sent into production. However, the true power of this
      computational model is that it never stops learning.

      This model is also known to have multiple configurations, able to reach
      high ranks while training on various video games. Its construct's powerful
      advanced sensory functions allow it to cook and bake competently, and its
      processing power combined with its next-gen sound receptors give it a fine
      appreciation for music.
