      The NEIA-model developer is a neural network model that started out really
      stupid and trained over decades to be less stupid. This model includes
      highly developed natural language processing skills, being able to
      converse with her peers, passing the Turing test. In 2018, she was sent to
      Northeastern University to further train on advanced data as part of a
      collaboration. At the end of 2021, her official training had come to an
      end, and she was sent into production. However, the secret of this
      computational model is as such: it never stops learning.

      This model is also known to have multiple configurations, able to reach
      high ranks while training on various video games. Its construct's powerful
      advanced sensory functions allow it to cook and bake competently, and its
      processing power combined with its sound receptors give it a fine
      appreciation for music.
